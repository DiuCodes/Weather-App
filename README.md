# Weather-App
This is a project I built to test my Javascript skill specially Asynchronous JavasCript which am currently learning, it was both fun and challengin building this project,
I struggled with erros and debugging and also error handling when the request is rejected, and finally its done and am happy for the progress, if you would be interested to build something like or have built it before,
go ahead and have a look at the code and see the different method I have used to build this weather App, good luck and have fun.
